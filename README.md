# exercises

Assorted Lean exercises. Numbered in order of creation. One hopes
that changes in style stem from an increase in knowledge and ability.

1. An exploration of the two-element set and Boolean algebra(s).

2. Exercises from *Theorem Proving in Lean 4.*

3. A "re-implementation" of the natural number type.

4. Linked list and Maybe monad. Adapted from an earlier Haskell project.

5. (Ongoing) Solutions to problems in *Real Analysis: The Game.* Updated according to in-game progress.

6. (Ongoing) A custom implementation of the Group typeclass and attendant structures.
